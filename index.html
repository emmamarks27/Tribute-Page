          The fifth of seven children, Marsha was born Malcolm Michaels Jr. to
          Malcolm Michaels Sr. and Alberta (Claiborne) Michaels on August 24,
          1945, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Marsha was educated in the Elizabeth
          Public School System and graduated from Thomas A. Edison High School
          in 1963. After graduating high school, she enrolled in the United
          States Navy for a brief stint.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marsha relocated to New York’s Greenwich Village to discover herself.
          As a transient, she turned to prostitution to survive and soon found a
          like-minded community within the nightlife of the village. She found
          joy as a self-made drag queen of Christopher Street, infamous for her
          unique design and costume creation. Throughout her discovery phase,
          she was referred to as Malcolm, and Black Marsha before settling on
          Marsha P. Johnson. The “P” stands for “Pay It No Mind.” Johnson
          quickly became a prominent fixture in the LGBTQ community serving as a
          “drag mother” helping homeless and struggling LGBTQ youth. Marsha was
          extremely successful and toured the world as a successful drag queen
          with the Hot Peaches.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although Marsha struggled with mental illness, she had a profound way
          of putting others’ needs before her own. Johnson remained in constant
          communication with her family and often returned home to Elizabeth in
          observance of the holidays. During her commute home, Marsha would
          invite wayward people to join her for a hot meal with her family.
          Marsha never visited home empty-handed, she would bring her nieces and
          nephews trinkets and flowers for her mother. Contrary to the belief,
          the family was very dear to Marsha’s heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her forthright nature and enduring strength led her to speak out
          against injustices. June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn on Christopher
          Street, things turned violent after members of the LGBTQ community
          were harassed by the NYPD sixth prescient. Many eyewitnesses have
          identified Marsha as one of the main instigators of the uprising and
          thus, some have recognized her as the vanguard of the gay liberation
          movement in the United States.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the events at Stonewall, Johnson and her friend Sylvia
          Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries
          (STAR) and they became fixtures in the community, helping homeless
          transgender youth. STAR provided services including shelter to
          homeless LGBTQ people in New York City, Chicago, California, and
          England for a few years in the early 1970s but eventually disbanded.
        </p>

        <p>
          July 6, 1992, Johnson’s body was found in the Hudson River off the
          West Village Piers. The police ruled she had committed suicide despite
          claims from her friends and other members of the local community that
          she was not suicidal. Twenty-five years later, Victoria Cruz, a crime
          victim advocate of the New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP)
          re-opened the case.
